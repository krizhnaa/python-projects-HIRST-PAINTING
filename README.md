In this Project we try emulate the Hirst painting by using Python.

> An example of Thirst painting provided in the file (image.jpg)

# <1> First colorgram package was used to extract the color from image.jpg with the help of a for-loop.
# <2> Positioning of the turtle was set
# <3> (.dot) was used for drawing dots.
# <4> Then with the help for-loop and other turtle functions, the painting was drawn.
# <5> After ten dots, next line was checked using 'dot_count % 10 == 0' condition.
# <6> Successfully implemented the Hirst Painting
